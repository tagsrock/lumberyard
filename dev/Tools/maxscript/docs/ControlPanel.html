<h1 style="background-color: rgb(192, 192, 192); font-family: Arial;">cryTools: Control Panel </h1>
<span style="font-family: Arial;"></span>
<h2 style="background-color: rgb(192, 192, 192); font-family: Arial;">
<img alt="Control Panel Rollout" src="images/controlpanel.png" style="border: 0px solid ; margin-right: 1em; width: 356px; height: 625px; float: left;">&nbsp;General Overview<br>
</h2>
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The control panel is a place where
you can set personal preferences specific to your workflow. It is
broken up into four main sections Art, Animation, Misc, and Debug Info.<br>
</span>
<h2 style="background-color: rgb(192, 192, 192);"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Art</span></h2>
<span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Check for Crytek shader at export [Default: ON]</span><br>
With this enabled, when the export button is pressed in the cryExport
utility rollout, cryTools will loop through all objects that are in the
current export list and check all of their materials and submaterials.
cryTools will generate a warning if it finds any non 'Crytek' materials
or any object with no defined material.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Re-parent biped twist bones at export [Default: ON]</span><br>
Biped forearm twist bones are parented to the upper arm for some weird
reason. They still work if you reparent them to the lower arm, but on
load they are always reparented to the upper arm. With this enabled,
the twist bones will be re-parented to the lower arm on character
export. This way they do not receive weird double transforms ingame.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Update:</span> This also reparents upper arm twists now<br>
<br>
</span>
<h2 style="background-color: rgb(192, 192, 192);"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Animation</span></h2>
<span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Load Old Animation tools</span><br>
When checked, the original <span style="font-weight: bold;">CryAnimTools</span> will load when <span style="font-weight: bold;">'CryAnimation'</span> is slected from the drop down.</span><br>
<span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Do not unparent $weapon_bone children at export [Default: OFF]</span><br>
I merged our 'animation rigs' into the main character Max file, because
any time the main character was updated, then the animation rig would
need to be updated. Now we animate on the actual character Max file.
Because of this, there are guns parented to the arms that you can cycle
through from within the Animation Tools. It is important that these
guns not export in the hierarchy. With this option checked, the weapon
objects will be exported, as skeletal nodes.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Update:</span> The following have been removed, but the commented code exists<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">Auto-update pose collections on max file open [Default: OFF]</span><br style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">
<span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">With this enabled, cryTools
will auto-update pose collections when you load a file. This is useful
when an animation team has a pose collection file somewhere on the
network or in P4. You can also click 'Get Latest P4' to manually sync
to the latest pose collections from the control panel without
restarting.</span><br style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">
<br style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">Sync pose collections at p4 start [Default: OFF]</span><br style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">
<span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">In addition to the above, each
animator can have their pose collections updated from a P4 location
every time he opens a maxfile.</span><br>
<br>
</span>
<h2 style="background-color: rgb(192, 192, 192);"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Misc</span></h2>
<span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Suppress all export warnings [Default: OFF]</span><br>
This is for advanced users. It disabled all warnings for shader
problems, hierarchy issues; everything. You really shouldn't enable
this unless working on some test items and getting annoyed with export
warnings.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Show splash screen [Default: ON]</span><br>
You can disable the splash screen here. It is a good idea to leave the
splash screen up as it has some information like your local
build/latest build and the version number, it is also up only during
the time it takes to load/initialize the tools. The cryTools splash
screen can be closed immediately by clicking anywhere on the screen,
you can also click menu items and things while it is up.<br>
<br>
</span>
<h2 style="background-color: rgb(192, 192, 192);"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Update/Uninstall/Rollback</span></h2>
<span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reload/Install Updates From Your Local Build</span><br>
This will reload cryTools, this is useful if you have copied over new
scripts, or updated your scripts via PerForce, AlienBrain, etc...<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Retreive Latest Tools/Sync</span><br>
When this is pressed, it uses the selected option to look for tools
updates. You need to set up the script to work with your P4 or
AlienBrain servers.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Rollback Exporter</span><br>
This rolls back to the last version of the exporter<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Uninstall Crytools</span><br>
This uninstalls the scripts<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">LOCAL/LATEST Build</span><br>
This shows the local and latest builds. The latest build is queried
from a build server, you will have to point it at your server.<br>
</span>
<h2 style="background-color: rgb(192, 192, 192);"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Debug Info</span></h2>
<span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">dump/remove callbacks</span><br>
If you click 'dump callbacks', all the callbacks cryTools has
registered will be echoed to the Maxscript Listener. If you click
'remove callbacks' nothing will happen, you have to right click it to
remove all callbacks cryTools has set. To reload the callbacks, you
must restart max, click 'Check/Install updates from your latest build'
in updateTools, or open the tools that registered the callback (like
riggingTools or animationTools)<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">dump crytek global vars</span><br>
This will dump any global variables set by cryTools. Crytools uses a global struct now and does not set as many global vars<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Various debug info</span><br>
Here you can check for problems. I echo out a lot of the vars that,
when missing or improperly set, can cause cryTools not to work or load.
I will quickly go through them:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">MAX VERSION:</span> Self explanatory<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">MAX PATH:</span> The 3D Studio Max install path<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">PROJECT:</span> Internally, this is
taken from your P4 root folder name. At Crytek, we use a naming scheme
like "Game02", "Game04", etc. This allows cryTools to be largely
project independent when syncing tools and things on P4.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">DOMAIN:</span> This is returned from a
cryTools function that returns the domain of the network the cryTools
users machine is on. This is useful when creating internal tools, it is
not secure, but it keeps debug stuff and hacks out of the UI.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">BUILD PATH: </span>This is the location of the build on the users local machine.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">CRYEXPORT.INI PATH: </span>The location of the cryexport.ini file<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">CRYTOOLS.INI PATH: </span>The location of the crytools.ini file where the control panel settings and various other things are stored.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">EDITOR PATH:</span> The local path to the editor.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">ROLLBACK STATUS:</span> If 'true',
cryTools is currently operating in a 'rolled back' state, and will not
attempt to get latest versions of the exporter and tools at max start.
'False' indicates normal operation.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">LOCAL BUILD #: </span>This is the number of the local build on the users HD.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">LATEST BUILD #: </span>This is the latest build number on the server (procedural builds)<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">LATEST BUILD ON SERVER: </span>This is the filename of the latest build on the server. <br>
<br>

'''
This file does the job of intercepting calls within WAF processes by 'monkey patching' (the
process of replacing a func with another func, which in turn calls the original func). In this
way we are able to have a minimal impact on build code as we do not have to instrument our
build with lots of calls into the metrics reporter. We are also easily able to add & remove
sections of reporting allowing us to dig into specific areas and report on them and then, once
an issue is resolved, simply remove the 'patch' - leaving the wrapper func available for
later use.

// Segmented World need XML Archive of editor level being split into multiple Archives
// Because multiArchive is a super set of single archive, Doc can always use it, with or without SW Level
// so some of the interface functions was written as always using MultiArchive
// However, to decouple other sandbox interfaces with SW stuff(prevent important header files from being polluted),
// it's better put it here as a generic implement and be included in both sides

// the current available slots for MultiArchive
// used by segmented world code through enum mapping (to EWDBType)

     * Emulate basic connectionless (UDP) socket behavior using \ref SharedMemory.
     * IMPORTANT: As with UDP socket behavior it's not guaranteed that all send will make it.
     * Generally all data is reliable UDP, but if one of the applications crashes or exit while
     * it sends or receives data we will clear all the data. So if you want your socket to work
     * properly even when the other apps crash/exit unexpectedly (so the OS must clean) you can just
     * just add a message id (which you increment every time) this time you can be sure the packets
     * are consecutive. If this is something we need often, we can write ReliableDirectSocket which
     * implements this basic strategy.

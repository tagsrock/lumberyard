To configure Lumberyard for a pre-2016 version of Wwise (2015.x, 2014.x), the 'wscript_wwise2015' file has been provided here.
If you are targeting a 2016 version of Wwise, you don't need to do steps 3-5.

Steps to Configure a different version of Wwise:

1) Make sure your new Wwise "SDK" folder is inside a \3rdParty\Wwise\<version>\ folder.  Look at the existing SDK as an example.

2) Open \dev\SetupAssistantConfig.json for edit, search for 'wwise'.  In that section you need to edit the following lines:
      The "version" line is friendly text shown in SetupAssistant.exe
      The first "source" line gives the location under \3rdParty\ where your SDK lives.
      The second "source" line (under "symlinks") will create a link from \3rdParty\ to \dev\Code\SDKs\ for the build system.

3) Navigate an explorer/finder window to \dev\Code\CryEngine\CrySoundSystem\implementations\CryAudioImplWwise\

4) Rename 'wscript' to 'wscript_wwise2016'

5) Rename 'wscript_wwise2015' to 'wscript'


Now you will need to run 'lmbr_waf configure' again, make sure there are no errors.  Once that's done, build the engine again,
this time it will link with your version of Wwise.

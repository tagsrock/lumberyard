// Description : declaration of struct CryEngineDecalInfo.

// Note:
//    3D Engine and Character Animation subsystems (as well as perhaps
//    some others) transfer data about the decals that need to be spawned
//    via this structure. This is to avoid passing many parameters through
//    each function call, and to save on copying these parameters when just
//    simply passing the structure from one function to another.

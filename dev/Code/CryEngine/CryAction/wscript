    # CryAction_AutoFlowNode is used to define the storage location for the symbols that
    # are used in the automatic flow node registration system (see CAutoRegFlowNodeBase)
    #
    # These symbols must be present in every executable or shared object that uses the
    # automatic registration pattern. Creating this modules independently of CryAction
    # allows us to depend on it from multiple locations -- e.g. Gems --
    # without pulling in a dependency on CryAction itself.
    #
    # (This works in all builds including monolithic)
